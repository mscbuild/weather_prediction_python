Weather Forecasting Application is one of the most common mini project in Software Development . In this article, we will create a weather forecasting app from scratch that will tell us the weather in any location in Latvian cities. We will be covering all the steps you have to do while developing this mini project. The title of our project will be Todays Weather App.

In our project as we will be exploring about the web application for weather app so will will be going to require following skill sets.

- Front end Development ( Html , CSS ).
- Python
- Back end Development ( JavaScript ).
- Tester
- UI/UX Developer

**Introduction** | Project Synopsys for Weather Forecasting Project :

Todays Weather app is a web application which will tell the users about the weather details of any particular city . The easy and Interactive User Interface will help our users to easily know about the temperature , wind speed , humidity and description about the weather .

**Problem Statement:**

Current weather apps lack simplicity and speed, making it challenging for users to quickly access accurate information for specific cities. There is a need for a streamlined web application that prioritizes user-friendly interfaces, delivering real-time, precise weather details for informed decision-making in travel, planning, and daily activities.

**Proposed Solution for Weather Forecasting Project :**

To overcome this the problem , We are going to make an web application using Html , CSS and JavaScript in which we will be providing user-friendly interface for easy navigation , 
Efficient weather searching , accurate and fast data collection. 

**Objective of the Project:**

The objective of the Todays weather project is to design and implement an efficient and user-friendly system that helps user to know about weather details of any city using its name only.

**Primary Goals of the project:**

- User-friendly Interface
- Accurate weather Details
- Fast data Fetching

**Technology Used:**

Here we are developing a Weather application using HTML, CSS for the frontend, and JavaScript for the backend involves a structured methodology. We are using OpenWeatherMap's API for the weather details .
